Intent - This code is intended to read through a grocery bill and generate SQL insert queries. The sql queries can thereafter be used to insert expence records to SQLlite db.

The SQL data can be used to analyze expenses and create analytics dashboards on it.


1. Create a DB schema to store the item details from bill into the database

    - Create a code Generative AI code that can generate Insert query from the image of the bills
    - Create a code that can insert query to insert data into the created table schema in 2

2. Create another table to store the bill metadata such as date of purchase, invoice number, Grand total , etc..

3. Create a AI code to generate queries that can analyse the expences and create charts based on the data in the tables

4. As always keep improving the design so that it can be more convinient to use.
